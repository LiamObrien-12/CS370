ðŸ“˜ Project Reflection: Pirate Intelligent Agent
Project Summary
In this project, I worked on developing a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning to navigate a maze and find treasure before other pirates. The starter code included a framework for the environment, rendering functions, and a skeletal deep Q-learning setup. My main task was to implement the Q-training algorithm and define the neural network architecture that could learn an optimal policy over time. I created the model structure, reward functions, experience replay mechanism, and the training loop logic. I also modified the training process to support batch updates, which was a key improvement based on milestone feedback to help the model train more efficiently and stably.

ðŸ’¡ Course Reflection & Learning
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems using logic, programming, and algorithms. This project showed how AI can be used in gaming, but similar techniques apply to robotics, healthcare, and logistics. By simulating decisions and outcomes, we can design systems that improve lives or automate tasks. Thatâ€™s why it mattersâ€”we build the tools that others rely on.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I start by breaking the problem into smaller steps, understanding whatâ€™s already available, and then iterating with code and testing. In this case, I had to understand how Q-learning works, experiment with model design, and debug training results based on how well the agent learned. Itâ€™s always about analyzing patterns, testing solutions, and improving based on feedback.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a developer, I need to make sure that the systems I create are reliable, fair, and transparent. Even in a game, AI decisions need to be explainable and behave as expected. In broader applications, this includes avoiding bias, protecting user data, and ensuring that decisions made by AI are aligned with human values. I also learned the importance of balancing performance with accountability, especially when deploying agents that learn from experience.
